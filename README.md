This repository is associated with the paper titled "Word Embeddings for Automatic Equalization in Audio Mixing" submitted to the Journal of Audio Engineering Society. The paper is under review.


The colab notebook used for training the models was [audio-and-word-embeddings-k-fold.ipynb](https://github.com/satvik-venkatesh/word-eq/blob/main/audio-and-word-embeddings-k-fold.ipynb). It is messy because it contains code for all word embedding models. I am in the process of creating separate notebooks for each word embedding model. 

EQ settings for semantic descriptors were using this notebook [audio-and-word-embeddings-error-plots.ipynb](https://github.com/satvik-venkatesh/word-eq/blob/main/audio-and-word-embeddings-error-plots.ipynb)
