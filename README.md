Using Word embeddings for automatic EQ mixing


The colab notebook that I used for training the models was [audio-and-word-embeddings-k-fold.ipynb](https://github.com/satvik-venkatesh/word-eq/blob/main/audio-and-word-embeddings-k-fold.ipynb). It is incredibly messy. I am in the process of creating separate notebooks for each word embedding model. 

I plotted the EQ settings for semantic descriptors using (audio-and-word-embeddings-error-plots.ipynb)[https://github.com/satvik-venkatesh/word-eq/blob/main/audio-and-word-embeddings-error-plots.ipynb]
